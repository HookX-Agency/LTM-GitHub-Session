What are you most interested about this event?
I am most interested in learning practical skills and gaining real-world knowledge from this event. Since I have attended a GitHub session by tutor Banshaj Paudel, I am especially excited to deepen my understanding of version control, collaboration using GitHub, and how to manage projects effectively. I look forward to improving my technical skills, networking with like-minded learners, and applying what I learn to my future projects.
